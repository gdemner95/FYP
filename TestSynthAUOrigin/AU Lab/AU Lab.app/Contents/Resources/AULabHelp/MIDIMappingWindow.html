When a MIDI controller is mapped to a specific control in the document such as the volume slider of a specific track, the MIDI mapping window shows the details for the mapping.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/MidiMappingWindow/MidiMappingWindow.gif" alt="The MIDI mappings window" width="455" height="234">			<p class="imageLabelCenter">The MIDI mappings window for an untitled document</p>		</div>					<p>The mappings window shows a table view of all of the mappings of the active document indicated by the window title. This window is automatically displayed when ever a new mapping is made between a control and a MIDI controller as long as the <a href="Preferences.html#openMidiMappings">Open MIDI mapping window when mapping controls preference</a> is set. To open the window manually, choose <strong>Show MIDI Mappings</strong> from the <strong>Window</strong> menu.</p>		<p>Each row in the mappings table represents a single mapping. The first column is the name of the track and the control for the mapping. For example, the first item in the mappings table shown above is mapped to the Pan controller of the Audio 1 track.</p>		<p>The second column is the source or endpoint name that the control is mapped to. The <strong>Event Type</strong> and <strong>ID</strong> columns specify the controller type and control number. Lastly, the <strong>Type </strong>column specifies whether the control should be used as a continuous controller (<strong>Value</strong>) or simple toggle on or off (<strong>Toggle</strong>). The value mode represents a range from 0 to 127 and is good for controls like the panner and the volume slider. Most button controls like the mute and solo buttons will default to Toggle mode but may also be switched to Value. In this mode, all numeric values less than 63 will be treated as off and all values over this limit will be treated as on.</p>				<h4>Adding a new mapping</h4>		<p>To establish a mapping between a control and a MIDI controller, hold the <a href="Preferences.html#Control%20Modifiers">MIDI Hotmap Modifier Key</a> (the default is command) while clicking the control with the mouse button that you wish to map. See <a href="Document.html#MIDIMapping">Control MIDI Mapping</a> for more information on control mapping.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/MidiMappingWindow/CancelMapping.gif" alt="" width="455" height="35">		</div>					<p>At this time, you may cancel the mapping by clicking the <strong>Cancel Mapping</strong> at the bottom of the MIDI Mappings window. To complete the hotmap, move the control on the MIDI controller that you want to link to the highlighted control. Once the control is moved, the mapping will be displayed as a new item in the mappings table.</p>		<h4>Removing a mapping</h4>		<p><img class="rightImage" src="gfx/MidiMappingWindow/RemoveMapping.gif" alt="" width="115" height="32">To remove a mapping, select the item in the mappings window you wish to remove. You will note that selecting the item will highlight the corresponding control in the document window. Click the <strong>Remove Mapping</strong> button at the bottom of the window to remove the mapping.</p>	</body></html>
