In addition, AU Lab can host Audio Unit effects and route audio through these effects.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/Intro/AU-Lab.jpg" alt="AU Lab application" width="490" height="295">			<p class="imageLabelCenter">The AU Lab Application</p>		</div>		<p>AU Lab is very efficient and has a very high performance and low overhead audio engine capable of supporting multiple outputs, full support for multichannel, and advanced routing features such as send buses and sidechain buses.</p>		<p>As the image above illustrates, the application provides MIDI clock facilities for audio units that support host clock synchronization, and an inspector that features a cocoa-based generic view of audio units that do not provide their own custom user interface. This inspector includes full support for preset management, and facilities for MIDI mapping of audio unit parameters.</p>		<p>Although AU Lab provides recording controls, it is not designed to be used for extensive recording. It is mainly designed as a platform reference Audio Unit host, and is designed for Audio Unit auditioning and live applications.</p>				<h4><a name="NewFeatures"></a>New Features in AU Lab</h4>		<p>New features include:</p>		<ul>			<li>New document configuration editor</li>			<li>Automatic creation of aggregate devices</li>			<li>Improved document configuration management</li>		</ul>	</body></html>
