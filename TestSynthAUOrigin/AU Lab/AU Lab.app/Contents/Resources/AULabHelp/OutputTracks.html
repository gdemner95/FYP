To edit the outputs, double-click on the title bar of the output group, or select it and choose <strong>Edit Selected Group&hellip;</strong> from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu. This will display the <em>Edit Master Outputs</em> sheet.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/Output/OutputEditor.gif" alt="" width="381" height="273">		</div>				<p>The <em>Edit Master Outputs</em> sheet allows you to edit the properties of the outputs. You can change the name of each output track (the text field shows the name of the selected track), the group color, and view the sample rate and number of frames of the device. You can also change the starting channel of any of the outputs by dragging the channel to a new location on the device.</p>		<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot change the device in this editor. Use the <strong>Studio Drawer</strong> to accomplish this task. See <a href="Drawer.html#audioStudioTab">Studio Drawer</a> for more information.				<p>For example, if a document is created using a multichannel device and then the device is switched to built-in audio, all inputs and outputs that are not on 1-2 will be displayed in the Unused Channels section as the above image illustrates. The channels still retain their channel assignments, but they will be ignored on a device with fewer channels.</p>		<p>You can change the individual channel assignments of each output track as described in <a href="CreatingADocument.html#usingAssistant">Changing the Channel Assignments</a>. As previously noted, channel assigments are not allowed to overlap.</p>		<p>If you wish to change any other device properties such as sample rate, you can click the <strong>Show Device Preferences</strong> button. For more information, see <a href="Preferences.html#Device%20Prefs">Device Preferences</a>.</p>	</body></html>
