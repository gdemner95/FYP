When creating a document, you 			specify the input and output track configurations as well as specify the speaker layout using the 			<strong>Document Configuration</strong> dialog. To create a new document, choose <strong>New</strong> 			from the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/DocConfigEditor.gif" alt="AULab create new document dialog" width="403" height="295" >			<p class="imageLabelCenter"><strong>NOTE:</strong> This dialog will only appear if the 			<a href="Preferences.html#OpenDocPrefs">document preferences</a> are set to &ldquo;Show document 			configuration dialog&rdquo;.</p>		</div>				<h4><a name="usingAssistant"></a>Using the Document Configuration Dialog</h4>		<p>	The Document Configuration Dialog provides facilities for specifying the configuration of a document. 			The dialog is separated into two panes. The left pane of the window has a list of configuration profiles 			that can be used as a starting point for the document. These configurations specify the number, arrangement, 			and composition of the input and output tracks. See <a href="CreatingADocument.html#SavingConfigurations">			Managing Configuration Profiles</a> for information on how to add and remove configuration profiles.</p>		<p>	The right pane of the window shows the input and output settings of the currently selected configuration 			profile. Input and output settings are in separate groups and allow the choice of device, source (if 			appropriate), and location and channel layout of each track on the selected device. See 			<a href="CreatingADocument.html#changingAudioDevice">Choosing the Audio Device</a> for more information on			how to configure the device settings.</p>					<h4><a name="SavingConfigurations"></a>Managing Configuration Profiles</h4>		<p>	<img class="rightImage" src="gfx/newDoc/ConfigList.gif" alt="" width="186" height="162">The Document Configuration			Dialog allows you to store commonly used profiles to speed document creation. Additionally, it provides a 			number of pre-made &ldquo;factory&rdquo; configurations for your convenience.</p>		<p> These premade configurations appear in a group labeled <span class="configName">Factory Configurations</span>. 			These configurations are not editable. When you create configurations, they are organized under the 			<span class="configName">User Configurations</span> group. Any user created configurations will be preserved			across application launches of AU Lab.</p>		<p>	To select a configuration to user for the a new document, choose the name of the configuration from this 			list. The settings panel on the right will show the track settings for the input and output of the selected			configuration.</p>					<h5><a name="CreatingConfigurations"></a>Creating a New Configuration</h5>		<p>	To create a new configuration, press the <img class="inlineImage2" src="gfx/newDoc/AddConfigButton.gif" alt="Plus" width="25" height="14"> 			button at the bottom of the configuration profiles list. This will open the configuration editor sheet 			which allows you to specify the name of the configuration and specify the configuration of the inputs and 			outputs. See <a href="CreatingADocument.html#ConfiguringOutputs">Configuring Outputs</a> and 			<a href="CreatingADocument.html#ConfiguringInputs">Configuring Inputs</a> for more information on how to 			configure the input and outputs settings.</p>					<h5><a name="RemovingConfigurations"></a>Removing an Existing Configuration</h5>		<p>	To remove an existing user configuration, select the configuration to remove from the configuration list, 			and press the <img class="inlineImage2" src="gfx/newDoc/RemoveConfigButton.gif" alt="Minus" width="22" height="14"> 			button at the bottom of the configuration profiles list. Note that factory configurations cannot be removed. </p>				<h5><a name="EditingConfigurations"></a>Editing Configurations</h5>		<p> To edit an existing user configuration, select a configuration from the configuration list and either double-click			on the name, or select <strong>Edit Configuration</strong> from the <img class="inlineImage2" src="gfx/newDoc/ActionButton.gif" alt="Action" width="22" height="14"> 			popup button. This will bring up the configuration editor. Make your changes, and click the <strong>OK</strong> 			button. Note that factory configurations cannot be edited.</p>					<p>	As a shortcut, you can rename a configuration by selecting it in the configuration list and choosing <strong>			Rename Configuration</strong> from the <img class="inlineImage2" src="gfx/newDoc/ActionButton.gif" alt="Action" width="22" height="14"> 			popup menu button. You can also duplicate existing configurations, as a basis for new ones.</p>				<h4><a name="ConfigurationSettings"></a>Configuration Settings</h4>		<p> Each configuration contains information about the inputs and outputs of a document. This profile is the 			basis of a document and must contain at least one output and may consist of one or more channels. An input			is optional.</p>		<p>	When creating a new profile, or editing an existing one, the configuration sheet is displayed with a			visual representation of the configuration. This represention is organized into two tabs- one for input,			and one for output.</p>					<h4><a name="ConfiguringOutputs"></a>Configuring Outputs</h4>		<p> When a new configuration is created, the default output configuration is a single stereo output track			as shown by the image below:</p>					<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/InitialOutputConfig.gif" alt="Initial Output Configuration" width="378" height="214">		</div>				<p>	You may add additional output channels by clicking on the <strong>Add Output</strong> button.</p>		<p>	You can change the number of channels for a selected track by choosing the number of channels from the 			<strong>Output Channels</strong> popup menu. There are three choices- <strong>Mono</strong>  (1 channel), 			<strong>Stereo</strong>  (2 channel), or <strong>Multichannel</strong> (more than two channels). If you 			select <strong>Multichannel</strong>, you will be able to specify the number of channels and the layout of			the speakers. See <a href="CreatingADocument.html#ConfiguringMultichannel">Specifying the Multichannel 			Configuration</a> for additional information.</p>		<p>	You can delete an existing track by clicking on the track in the configuration diagram, or select the track			from the <strong>Selected Output</strong> popup menu and then click the <strong>Remove Output</strong> 			button. Note that you must always have at least one output track, so it is not possible to remove the last			track in the output configuration.</p>					<p>	The following image shows an output configuration with a 6 channel output track followed by a stereo output			track. The stereo track is selected.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/NewOutputAdded.gif" alt="New Output Added" width="369" height="126">		</div>				<h5><a name="ConfiguringMultichannel"></a>Specifying the Multichannel Configuration</h5>		<p>	When a multichannel track is created, the Configuration Sheet expands, showing additional 			options for specifying the channel layout. Note that there can only be a single multichannel format per 			document. If multiple multichannel output tracks are created, they will all use the same number of			channels.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<p><img src="gfx/newDoc/MultichannelConfig.gif" alt="New Output Added" width="353" height="300"></p>		</div>				<p>	These new controls include a <strong>Channel Configuration</strong> popup menu for specifying the 			configuration type, as well as a graphic representation of the speaker layout and an area for additional 			customization based on the configuration type.</p>		<p>	There are three supported configuration types in AU Lab:</p>		<h5>Constrained</h5>		<p>			<img class="leftImage" src="gfx/newDoc/Constrained.gif" alt="Constrained" width="100" height="100">			The constrained multichannel configuration type is a speaker layout consisting of 3 or more speakers 			arranged in an arc in front of the listener. Each speaker is spaced equally, and the first and last speaker			define a spanning angle. After selecting this configuration from the <strong>Channel Configuration</strong>			popup menu, the editor will display two additional text fields for editing the number of speakers and angle			between the first and last speakers. There is a maximum of 8 speakers for this configuration.		</p>		<h5>Surround</h5>		<p>	The surround multichannel configuration type is a speaker layout using five or more satellite speakers and 			a subwoofer for low frequencies. This arrangement is typically used for home theater applications and 			includes common layouts such as 5.1, 6.1, and two 7.1 variations. There is a checkbox in the editor that 			allows the lfe channel to be removed if desired. In the below diagram, the listener is placed in the center			of the listening circle and is indicated with a small crosshair. </p>		<div>			<table width="422" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">				<tr>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/5_1.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/6_1.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/7_1Front.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/7_1Rear.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter"> 5.1 </p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter"> 6.1 </p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter"> 7.1 Front </p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter"> 7.1 Rear </p></td>				</tr>			</table>		</div>		<h5>Geometric</h5>		<p>	The geometric multichannel configuration type is a speaker layout where the speakers are configured in an 			evenly spaced geometry around the listener. There are four different geometric types based on 4, 5, 6, and			8 speakers. </p>		<div>			<table width="180" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">				<tr>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/Quad.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/Pentagonal.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/Hexagonal.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/Octagonal.gif" alt="" width="100" height="100"></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter">Quadraphonic</p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter">Pentagonal</p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter">Hexagonal</p></td>					<td><p class="imageLabelCenter">Octagonal</p></td>				</tr>			</table>		</div>				<h4><a name="ConfiguringInputs"></a>Configuring Inputs</h4>		<p>	Click on the inputs tab at the top of the sheet to edit the input channel configuration. The Input section			offers much less choice of channel selection since only mono and stereo tracks are supported.</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/InputConfig.gif" alt="Adding inputs" width="353" height="200">		</div>				<p>	You may use the <strong>Add Input</strong> and <strong>Remove Input</strong> buttons to add and remove 			inputs. Unlike outputs, a document is not required to have inputs.</p>		<p> Once you are satisfied with your input and output track configurations, click the <strong>OK</strong> 			button to create the configuration.</p>					<h4><a name="changingAudioDevice"></a>Choosing the Audio Device</h4>		<p> The choice of the audio device is independent of the configuration profile of a document. The audio			device selection is organized into two groups, one for input and one for output.</p>		<p> You may use any audio device on your system such as your built-in audio hardware, an audio interface 			connected via firewire, a device connected via USB, or an aggregate device.</p>		<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The input and the output device do not need to be the same device.</p>				<p>	To choose an audio device, select an input device name from the <strong>Audio Input Device</strong> popup			menu and an output device name from the <strong>Audio Output Device </strong>popup menu. If your device supports changing the input source, you may select a source such as <em>Internal 			Microphone</em> or <em>Line In</em> using the <strong>Input Source</strong> popup button.</p>				<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/InputSettings.gif" alt="Adding inputs" width="339" height="135">			<p class="imageLabelCenter">Input Settings</p>		</div>				<h4><a name="changingChannelAssignments"></a>Changing the Channel Assignments</h4>		<p>	At the bottom of the Input Settings and Output Settings groups is a view that shows the location of			each track in the profile. This view shows a visual representation of the numbers of channels available 			for the selected device. A stereo device such as the built-in audio has only two available channels, while			a multichannel firewire device may have several channels grouped into discrete streams. For example, the 			image below shows an output device that has ten (10) output channels all grouped as a single stream.</p>					<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/MultichannelDevice.gif" alt="Multichannel Device" width="351" height="57">		</div>			<p>	To change the channel assignments of a particular track, simply select the track to be moved, and drag it 			to a new location. For example, the image below shows an input track being moved from channels 1-2 on the 			device to channels 3-4:</p>		<div class="centerSection">			<img src="gfx/newDoc/MovingChannels.gif" alt="Moving inputs" width="417" height="63">		</div>		<p>	In addition to changing channel assignments in a group, output channel assignments can be made on an			individual basis. This is useful, for example, if you need to reorder your channel assignments on a 			multichannel device. To do this, uncheck the <strong>Link Channel Groups</strong> button.</p>		<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Once channels have been unlinked, they can be moved individually:</p>				<div class="centerSection">			<br><img src="gfx/newDoc/UnlinkedChannels.gif" alt="Moving inputs" width="444" height="94">		</div>				<p>	Take care to ensure that none of the channel assignments overlap on the output section. Each individual 			channel has a label that indicates which speaker the output corresponds to. These are abbreviated as 			follows:</p><table width="210" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">			<tr>				<td>L</td>				<td>Left</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>R</td>				<td>Right</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>C</td>				<td>Center</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Ls</td>				<td>Left Surround</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Rs</td>				<td>Right Surround</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Lrs</td>				<td>Left Rear Surround</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Rrs</td>				<td>Right Rear Surround</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Lc</td>				<td>Left Center</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>Rc</td>				<td>Right Center</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>LFE  </td>				<td>Low Frequency Effects</td>			</tr>		</table>		<p></p>		<p class="Note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Default channel assignments for multichannel tracks are based on the 			device&rsquo;s preferred channel layout. An Application such as <em>Audio MIDI Setup</em> may be used to 			specify this default layout.</p>		<p>	A document may have more output channels than supported by the device it is running on. For example, if you			have selected Built-in audio for the source of your document, you may have a maximum of two output channels			in use. Once these channels are used, any additional channel groups you create will be marked as <strong>			Unused Channels</strong>. These channel groups will be created, but cannot be routed to a device			channel.</p> 		<p>	If you were to change the source to a device that supports more than two output channels, you 			would then be able to move the group to a specific channel assignment on the multichannel device. To do 			this, drag the group from the unused channel section to the channels of the device that you want to use. 			Note that overlapping output channels are not allowed.</p>		<div>			<table width="174" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">				<tr>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/MultiOutputs.gif" alt="Built-in Audio Unused Channels" width="302" height="85"></td>					<td><img src="gfx/newDoc/MultiOutputsUnused.gif" alt="Multichannel unused channels" width="302" height="85"></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>						<p class="imageLabelCenter">Unused channels on built-in audio</p>					</td>					<td>						<p class="imageLabelCenter">Unused channels on a multichannel device</p>					</td>				</tr>			</table>		</div>		<p>	This feature can be very useful because it allows the configuration of a document that has more output 			channels than the output device. At a later time, the document can be reconfigured on a multichannel device.			The channel assignments will be preserved as the document is switched between devices.</p>		<p>	Once you have completed configuration of the document, click the <strong>OK</strong> button to dismiss the 			configuration dialog and create the document. If at any time, you wish to make changes to the input or output 			track configurations, you select a different configuration, or edit the selected configuration.</p>		</body></html>
